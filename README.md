# hello_world
First GitHub repository
What a wonderful world!
This is the first jazz I am entering into GitHub in order to understand more about how it works. There is no need to look for my earlier material because it does not exist. People have tried. They were lost deep in forrest, fell off cliffs into deep ravines, and large animals ate them whole (no bite marks). 
I tied a key to a kite, but it wasn't windy.
Good night, ch'all.
